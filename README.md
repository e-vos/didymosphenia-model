# Didymosphenia geminata model

This model simulates the invasion of the diatom Didymosphenia geminata in a freshwater system.

Didymosphenia geminata, also known as didymo or rock snot, is a type of freshwater diatom that has become invasive in many rivers and streams worldwide. The species is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, but its introduction to new environments has led to significant ecological and economic impacts. 

Per the [USGS Didymosphenia geminata fact sheet](https://nas.er.usgs.gov/queries/greatlakes/FactSheet.aspx?Species_ID=2856):

>Didymosphenia geminata can be found in freshwater rivers, streams and lakes. This taxon prefers cool water of low conductivity (Patrick and Reimer 1975) ... The species is predominantly benthic but has been observed in planktonic samples (Blanco and Ector 2009). It prefers clear streams and rivers with shallow, moderately-flowing water with a pH of 7 or above and rocky substrate (MISIN 2017; Sea Grant Pennsylvania 2013; Spaulding and Elwell 2007). Historically the species was restricted to low-nutrient waters but has recently seen large range expansions reportedly occurring in eutrophic rivers, showing much greater tolerance for nutrient and flow conditions than previously expected. This may be attributed to a genetic variant with broader tolerances than the original species.  Nuisance benthic growths are only known to occur in flowing water.  While this species seems to be confined to cold areas, it reaches its highest biomass at higher water temperatures of ~20°C (Blanco and Ector 2009). It has also been observed at temperatures of 27°C (Spaulding and Elwell 2007).

Given its ability to survive out of water for several weeks, its introduction into new systems is a major environmental concern. According to the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management, "Nuisance didymo blooms can completely cover the stream bottom, smothering aquatic plants, native mussel beds and ruining habitat for beneficial insects."

To prevent its spread, several states have banned the use of felt soled boots and waders entirely. Its ability to remain viable out of water for such an extended length of time, however, poses difficulties in preventing its spread to susceptible areas.

## Model considerations

This model uses several key environmental factors to simulate the spread of D. geminata. In this version, these are water flow, nutrient level, temperature, and day length. Although research into D. geminata's physiology is ongoing, it has been found to take advantage of oligotrophic conditions in moderately-flowing water. It can grow in a range of temperatures, but prefers water to be cooler than 20 C. Day length is considered because D. geminata is photosynthetic.
